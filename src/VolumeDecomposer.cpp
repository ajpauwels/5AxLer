/**
 * findPolyFaceIntersection is fairly straightforward:
 * 1. Iterate through each line segment in the polygon
 * 2. Take the mesh face and the two points of the line and pass them through the following equations:
 *		d = (n_x * x_0) + (n_y * y_0) + (n_z * z_0)
 *		t = (d - x_0 - y_0 - z_0) / (deltaX + deltaY + deltaZ)
 *		
 *		d is part of the scalar equation of the plane
 *		<n_x, n_y, n_z> are the face's normal
 *		<x_0, y_0, z_0> in the top equation is the <x, y, z> of one of the face's vertices
 *		<x_0, y_0, z_0> in the bottom equation is the <x, y, z> of one of the endpoints of the line
 *		deltaX = x_1 - x_0, where x_1 is the other endpoint of the line's x-coordinate (etc for deltaY, deltaZ)
 * 3. Now we check t. If 0 <= t <= 1, then the line from the comparison poly intersects the face
 * 4. In that case, we plug t into the following equation to get the final intersection's <x, y, z>:
 *		r(t) = <x_0 + deltaX*t, y_0 + deltaY*t, z_0 + deltaZ*t>
 *		<x_0, y_0, z_0> is the first endpoint of the line
 *		deltaX etc are defined as above
 * 5. Otherwise, the line does not intersect and we move on to the next line
 * 6. If no intersections are found, an exception is thrown
